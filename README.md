# Road Trips & Hikes API service

## Purpose

This Django Project currently consists of two Apps: an API wrapper and a Stats API

### API Wrapper

In order to protect credentials & API keys when using data from public APIs like Flickr and Blogger, this service makes an authenticated call to the original endpoint and only forwards the necessary fields (JSON) in a "wrapper" call used by the frontend.

Additionally, because all the sensitive information is kept in a separate JSON file *outside of source control*, the Django code can be safely commited to GitHub.

Currently, only one API (Blogger) is configured but there are plans to incude more like Flickr, Twitter, etc. This call fetches the Latest Blog Post from https://roadtripsandhikes.blogspot.com/.

### Stats API

This App is an instance of the Django Rest Framework. It was initially conceived as a way to store my own hiking stats and be able to share the details on other pages.

There are two Models: Person, Hike

A Person consists of:
- "first_name"
- "last_name"
- "slug": (autogenerated)
- "join_date": (autogenerated)
- "email"
- "profile_img"

A Hike consists of:
- "hike_date"
- "location"
- "state"
- "distance_mi"
- "elevation_gain_ft"
- "highest_elev_ft"
- "alltrails_url"
- "blogger_url"
- "hiker" (foreign key)

Overall Stats are calculated for each user and included in the the Person endpoint.
- "total_hikes"
- "total_miles"
- "total_elev_feet"
- "highest_elev_feet"

The Overall Stats are surfaced in a web view:
- By Slug https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/larry-moiola/?2021 - Custom CSS - full page view
- By Slug https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/larry-moiola/?rgba(255,33,0,0.7) - (dark-orange bg, white text) - Widget view (w/ custom bg)
- By Slug https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/larry-moiola/ - (default: black bg, white text) - Widget view
- By Id https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/1/?2021 - Custom CSS - full page view
- By Id https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/1/?2021?rgba(255,33,0,0.7) - (dark-orange bg, white text) - Widget view (w/ custom bg)
- By Id https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/1/ - (default: black bg, white text) - Widget view

The URL args are used to toggle Widget vs Full Page via when the page is loaded (JavaScript).
- If no arg, the widget view with default colors is returned
- If "?2021", the full-page view is returned
- If a valid RGBA code, e.g. "rgba(0,0,0,1)", the widget view is return with custom color
- If anything else, the widget view with default colors is returned

The Stats API requires an API-Key or you have to be logged in as a Django Admin. 
- An "Authorization" header can be set with value "Api-Key aA1bB2cC3.dD4eE5fF6gG7hH8iI9jJ0kK1lL2mM3nN4oO5" in Postman
- *Do not use the Authorization > API-Key field*

This interface supports the CRUD operations via the DRF web form and JSON.
(*need to verify new Hikes are created with JSON - was having issue with foreign key assignment*)

### Future Plans

- Add filtering Hikes by Year
  - Parse Year from existing date (2021-10-11)
  - Autogenerate and store separate Year field
  - Target: DRF UI and /hiking-stats/for/<slug or id>/?2021
- Add more fields to Hike
  - Map coordinates
  - Rating: 1 - 5 stars
  - Difficulty (easy, moderate, difficult, 1, 2, 3)
  - Conditions (rocky, muddy, windy, great) (many-to-one)
  - Activity Type (hiking, running, horseback, mtn bike) (many-to-one)
  - Photos (many-to-one)
  - Notes
  - More fields from AllTrails
    - Moving Time
    - Total Time
    - Average Pace
    - Calories
- Add more fields to Person (tbd)
- Add more calculations in Overall Stats
  - Average length (miles)
  - Average elevations gain (feet)
