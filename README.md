# Road Trips & Hikes API service

## Purpose

This Django Project currently consists of two Apps: an API wrapper and a Stats API

### API Wrapper

In order to protect credentials & API keys when using data from public APIs like Flickr and Blogger, this service makes an authenticated call to the original endpoint and only forwards the necessary fields (JSON) in a "wrapper" call used by the frontend.

Additionally, because all the sensitive information is kept in a separate JSON file *outside of source control*, the Django code can be safely commited to GitHub.

Currently, only one API (Blogger) is configured but there are plans to incude more like Flickr, Twitter, etc. This call fetches the Latest Blog Post from https://roadtripsandhikes.blogspot.com/.

### Stats API

This App is an instance of the Django Rest Framework. It was initially conceived as a way to store my own hiking stats and be able to share the details on other pages.

There are two Models: Person, Hike

A Person consists of:
- "first_name"
- "last_name"
- "slug": (autogenerated)
- "join_date": (autogenerated)
- "email"
- "profile_img"

A Hike consists of:
- "hike_date"
- "location"
- "state"
- "distance_mi"
- "elevation_gain_ft"
- "highest_elev_ft"
- "alltrails_url"
- "blogger_url"
- "hiker" (foreign key)

Overall Stats are calculated for each user and included in the the Person endpoint.
- "total_hikes"
- "total_miles"
- "total_elev_feet"
- "highest_elev_feet"

The Overall Stats are surfaced in a web view:
- By Slug https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/larry-moiola/?2021 - Full page view w/ custom CSS
- By Slug https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/larry-moiola/?rgba(255,33,0,0.7) - Widget view (w/ custom bg: dark-orange bg, white text)
- By Slug https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/larry-moiola/ - (default: black bg, white text) - Widget view
- By Id https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/1/?2021 - Full page view w/ custom CSS
- By Id https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/1/?2021?rgba(255,33,0,0.7) - Widget view (w/ custom bg: dark-orange bg, white text)
- By Id https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hiking-stats/for/1/ - (default: black bg, white text) - Widget view

The URL args are used to toggle Widget vs Full Page via when the page is loaded (JavaScript).
- If no arg, the widget view with default colors is returned
- If "?2021", the full-page view is returned
- If a valid RGBA code, e.g. "rgba(0,0,0,1)", the widget view is return with custom color
- If anything else, the widget view with default colors is returned

### Note: The widget is currently used on https://roadtripsandhikes.blogspot.com, shown under the header.

The Stats API requires an API-Key or you have to be logged in as a Django Admin.
- An "Authorization" header can be set with value "Api-Key aA1bB2cC3.dD4eE5fF6gG7hH8iI9jJ0kK1lL2mM3nN4oO5" in Postman
- *Do not use the Authorization > API-Key field*

This interface supports the CRUD operations via the DRF web form and JSON.
(*need to verify new Hikes are created with JSON - was having issue with foreign key assignment*)

In order to allow the widget to be embedded (iframe) on Blogger, I'm using "@xframe_options_exempt" decorator.
The major browsers have increased security protections (to address clickjacking), and block content from being loaded in frames/iframes by default. The decorator gives exemption to this particular view.

### Date filtering

- By year (this filters Hikes, hikes[], aggregates values):
  - https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hikes/?hiker=1&year=2021
  - https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/persons/1/?year=2021

- By start_date & end_date (this filters Hikes only):
  - https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hikes/?hiker=1&start_date=2021-05-03&end_date=2021-06-04
  - https://api.roadtripsandhikes.org/hikes/?hiker=1&hike_date__gte=2021-05-03&hike_date__lt=2021-06-04
